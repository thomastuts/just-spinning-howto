# Just Spinning - Twitch Hackathon Submission

Hello, Twitch judges! This is a basic repo to point you in the right direction. The Just Spinning project exists in three repositories:

- https://github.com/thomastuts/just-spinning-viewer
- https://github.com/thomastuts/just-spinning-extension
- https://github.com/thomastuts/just-spinning-ebs

Each repository has its own set of instructions. The repositories are private, and the `twitchdevelopers` GitHub user has been invited to all repositories listed above.
